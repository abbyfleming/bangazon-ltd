# Documenting Ruby

Through this course, you will be documenting all of your code. In Ruby, you will be using RDoc to accomplish this.

You are strongly encouraged to read the [RDoc Documentation](https://github.com/ruby/rdoc)  for guidance on the standard conventions that the Ruby developer community uses for documentation.

We will be following the guideline below, and the instruction staff will be making sure that you conform to it.

> Rdoc vs yard

You should already be commenting the crap out of your code. If you haven't been, its time to start. 

Here's a little bit about [comments](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#comments) in Ruby.


You can define documentation programmatically for a function using [YARD](https://yardoc.org/). The [Definition of Done](../EMPLOYEE_HANDBOOK.md) requires full documentation.

```
# Desribe the behaviour of the method
    #
    # ==== Attributes
    #
    # * +name+ - Document the first attribute
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #
    # Illustrate the behaviour of the method using examples. Indent examples:
    #
    #    display_name("John")
```
